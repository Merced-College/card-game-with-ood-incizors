# cardsWithOOD

# Name: Garret Clark
# Date: 6/18/25

# Modifications to the code: 
# Added a Card field.
# Added a picture class, along with all constructors, accessors, mutators and more to support it.
# Added a section of code that display's the player's most valuable card as output. 
# Added improvements to the code, such as try-with-resources for file reading, Collections.shuffle for shuffling, carrd dealing improvements, Java streams, and more. 

# I couldn't figure out how to commit directly from GitHub Codespaces, so I instead pasted my work here class by class. GitHub is still very, very confusing for me to learn.
